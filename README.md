# DWARF 3 Alpaca Server

An ASCOM Alpaca device hub for the DWARF 3 smart telescope. The project speaks the DWARF control protocols (websocket, HTTP/JSON, FTP, RTSP, BLE) and exposes Telescope/0, Camera/0, Focuser/0, and FilterWheel/0 devices that can be driven from clients such as NINA, Voyager, or ASCOM Remote.

---

## Highlights

- **End-to-end DWARF bridge** – `DwarfSession` maintains websocket, HTTP, FTP, and BLE clients, negotiates the master lock, and caches notifications for low-latency Alpaca responses.
- **Full Alpaca surface area** – Telescope, camera, focuser, and filter wheel routers translate Alpaca verbs into real DWARF commands including go-to slews, joystick motion, exposure setup, filter selection, and temperature polling.
- **Capture pipeline** – Exposure requests map durations to DWARF parameter tables, monitor dark-library status, trigger astro captures, and harvest results from the onboard FTP album.
- **Filter handling** – Automatic discovery of filter definitions, IR-cut coordination, and persistence of the active slot for imaging tasks.
- **Provisioning workflow** – BLE onboarding stores STA credentials in `var/connectivity.json`, updates settings dynamically, and feeds the combined `dwarf-alpaca start` command.
- **Structured logging & tests** – `structlog` JSON output, rotating startup logs, and a pytest suite covering discovery, CLI flows, session orchestration, and device endpoints.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A shell: commands below use Windows PowerShell; for macOS/Linux use the POSIX
  equivalents (`source .venv/bin/activate`, `export VAR=value`). Linux users
  should also see [`setup_linux.md`](setup_linux.md).
- System packages required by `aiortc` / `av` (FFmpeg, libopus, etc.)
- Optional: Bluetooth adapter compatible with [Bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak)
  (on Linux this needs BlueZ and a running `bluetooth` service)

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .
```

For development extras (ruff, pytest, httpx CLI):

```powershell
pip install -e .[development]
```

### 3. Choose a connection mode

| Scenario | How to run |
| --- | --- |
| **Simulation** | Set `DWARF_ALPACA_FORCE_SIMULATION=true` then `dwarf-alpaca serve`. PowerShell: `$env:DWARF_ALPACA_FORCE_SIMULATION = "true"`; POSIX shell: `export DWARF_ALPACA_FORCE_SIMULATION=true`. The routers respond with synthetic data, ideal for UI development and tests. |
| **Hardware (existing Wi-Fi)** | Ensure the DWARF is connected to your Wi-Fi and that its STA IP is recorded in `var/connectivity.json` (or supply `--ssid`/`--password`). Run `dwarf-alpaca start --skip-provision --wait-timeout 180`. |
| **Hardware (provisioning required)** | Use the BLE guide to onboard Wi-Fi credentials: `dwarf-alpaca guide --adapter <optional-device> --ble-password <password>`. Credentials and STA IP are saved for subsequent runs. |

### 4. All-in-one launch

```powershell
dwarf-alpaca start --ssid "MySSID" --password "MyPassword" 
# ssid and password are optional arguments
```

- Prompts for BLE password if not provided (defaults to `DWARF_12345678`).
- Provisions the telescope, waits for STA connectivity, acquires the master lock, and starts the HTTP + discovery services.
- STA IP detection automatically updates `Settings.dwarf_ap_ip` before the server boots.

> Looking for the packaged GUI? Follow [`setup.md`](setup.md) for the Windows Control Center, or [`setup_linux.md`](setup_linux.md) for the Linux AppImage and CLI, including how to configure clients such as NINA.

---

## Building the GUI

The PySide6 Control Center freezes into a standalone artifact with
[PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org) using the shared, cross-platform spec at
`packaging/dwarf_alpaca_gui.spec`. Install PyInstaller once per environment
(`pip install pyinstaller`) and generate the protobuf modules first
(`bash gen_pb2.sh`).

### Windows (`.exe`)

```powershell
pyinstaller --noconfirm packaging\dwarf_alpaca_gui.spec
```

The packaged binary is created at `dist\DwarfAlpacaGUI.exe`.

### Linux (AppImage)

```bash
bash scripts/build_appimage.sh
```

This runs PyInstaller with the same spec, assembles an AppDir (binary,
`.desktop`, icon, `AppRun`), and wraps it with `appimagetool` into
`dist/DwarfAlpacaGUI-x86_64.AppImage`. See [`setup_linux.md`](setup_linux.md)
for the host libraries required to build and run it.

Both artifacts are also produced automatically by CI
(`.github/workflows/build.yml`) and attached to tagged releases.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dwarf-alpaca serve [--config path] [--ws-client-id value]` | Start only the Alpaca/HTTP/UDP services using the current settings. |
| `dwarf-alpaca start [options]` | Provision (optional), wait for connectivity, warm up the DWARF session, and then serve Alpaca. Supports `--skip-provision`, `--wait-timeout`, `--wait-interval`, and websocket client overrides. |
| `dwarf-alpaca guide [--adapter name] [--ble-password value]` | Interactive Bluetooth guide that lists DWARF devices, nearby SSIDs, and saves credentials. |
| `dwarf-alpaca provision [options] <SSID> <password>` | Non-interactive provisioning suitable for automation once you know the BLE address and Wi-Fi credentials. |

Rotating startup logs live in `var/logs/dwarf-alpaca-start.log` for later diagnosis.

---

## Configuration Cheatsheet

Settings may be supplied via env vars (`DWARF_ALPACA_*`), `.env`, or a YAML profile loaded with `--config`. Key options from `config/settings.py`:

| `http_scheme` | `http` | Switch to `https` when TLS files are provided. |
| `http_advertise_host` | `None` | Override the host reported in discovery packets. Auto-detected when unset. |
| `discovery_enabled` | `True` | Disable if another service handles UDP discovery. |
| `dwarf_ap_ip` | `192.168.88.1` | Fallback AP address. Overridden with STA IP after provisioning. |
| `dwarf_http_port` / `dwarf_jpeg_port` | `8082` / `8092` | DWARF REST/album ports. |
| `dwarf_ws_port` / `dwarf_rtsp_port` / `dwarf_ftp_port` | `9900` / `554` / `21` | Control-plane websocket, RTSP streaming, and FTP album ports. |
| `dwarf_ws_client_id` | `0000DAF3-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB` | Client identifier required to acquire the master lock. Adjust per hardware variant. |
| `ws_ping_interval_seconds` | `5.0` | Heartbeat cadence for the websocket. |
| `go_live_before_exposure` | `True` | Enable/disable RTSP warm-up before astro captures. |
| `allow_continue_without_darks` | `True` | Permit exposures when the dark library check fails. |
| `temperature_refresh_interval_seconds` | `5.0` | How often to poll DWARF temperature notifications. |
| `ble_adapter` / `ble_password` | `None` | Defaults for provisioning workflows. |
| `force_simulation` | `False` | Bypass hardware access and return simulated data. |

See `config/profiles.yaml` for sample overlays.

## Runtime Architecture (Summary)

- **DiscoveryService** – Async UDP responder advertising device metadata and the HTTP URL.
- **FastAPI app** – Mounts Alpaca management, telescope, camera, focuser, and filter wheel routers. Middleware emits structured access logs.
- **DwarfSession** – Central orchestrator that:
  - Manages the websocket client (`DwarfWsClient`) for commands/notifications and master lock stewardship.
  - Wraps `DwarfHttpClient`, `DwarfFtpClient`, and `DwarfRtspClient` for REST, album, and live view access.
  - Handles exposure scheduling, filter presets, gain/exposure lookup tables, dark-library enforcement, and temperature monitoring.
  - Tracks device reference counts so connections tear down only when all Alpaca devices disconnect.
- **Provisioning workflow** – Uses `DwarfBleProvisioner` to push Wi-Fi credentials and persists STA state via `StateStore`.
- **Tests** – Cover CLI plumbing, UDP discovery packets, session behaviour, and endpoint compliance.

For a deeper exploration see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

---

## Observing Workflow

1. **Provision / connect** – Use `dwarf-alpaca start` to provision (if necessary) and acquire the DWARF master lock.
2. **Discover** – Clients broadcast Alpaca discovery; this server replies with Telescope/0, Camera/0, Focuser/0, FilterWheel/0 entries.
3. **Slew & track** – Telescope slews translate to DWARF astro GOTO commands; recent slews are cached for exposure validation.
4. **Focus** – Manual and continuous focus moves map to DWARF focus commands with live position updates from notifications.
5. **Filter selection** – Filter wheel positions are read from DWARF parameters; IR-cut toggles are applied when required.
6. **Capture** – Exposure requests ensure gain/exposure indices, start astro capture, watch dark library state, and fetch the resulting image via FTP.
7. **Telemetry** – Temperature and camera metadata stream back into Alpaca GET endpoints for real-time monitoring.

---

## Testing

```powershell
pytest
```

The suite includes UDP discovery tests, CLI smoke coverage, session logic (mocked hardware), and device API verification. Add `-k` or `-m` filters when iterating on specific components.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Suggestion |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery packets missing | Ensure UDP broadcasts reach the client network; set `http_advertise_host` to a routable IP. |
| Master lock denied | Confirm the websocket client ID matches your hardware family (DWARF3 vs DWARF2/Mini). |
| Exposures timeout | Check FTP connectivity to the STA IP; increase `ftp_timeout_seconds` / `ftp_poll_interval_seconds`. |
| BLE provisioning stalls | Supply `--ble-password` explicitly and verify the adapter name via `Get-PnpDevice -Class Bluetooth`. |
| RTSP preview unavailable | Install FFmpeg/AV dependencies and verify `dwarf_rtsp_port` (default 554) is reachable. |

---

## Roadmap

- Populate telescope site coordinates from settings and persist between sessions.
- Surface live pointing data (RA/Dec/Alt/Az) from websocket notifications rather than simulated motion when telemetry is available.
- Integrate RTSP preview frames into Alpaca `ImageArray` for faster plate solving.
- Expand automated tests with hardware-in-the-loop fixtures when a DWARF lab unit is available.
- Optional authentication / TLS profile for remote observatories.
